	<p>Before reading this, make sure that you've read the <a href="../introduction">Introduction</a>.</p>
	<p>Upon downloading the latest version of ETGMod.Installer, run it (with Mono on Linux/Mac or .NET on Windows). You will be presented with an image on the left and a few options on the right.</p>
	<p>If you're using the Steam version, the installer should autodetect where Gungeon data is; if not, you can select the executable at the top (<code>Step 1</code>).</p>
	<p>To install the base backend, just click <code>Install ETGMod</code> at the bottom. Wait for the process to finish - the log will tell you what's happening and it'll tell you when the process has finished. Once finished, close the installer. You can now <a href="../mods/installing">install mods</a>.</p>
	<p>The second step is used for installing custom backends. You shouldn't need to use it unless an author of a mod instructed you to - in that case, read the tutorial on <a href="../backends/installing">Installing Backends</a>.</p>
	<p>The game should now have <code>Mod the Gungeon</code> along with a version written next to the patch version on the main menu.</p>
